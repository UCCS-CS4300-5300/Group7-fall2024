Jagger Zlotoff: I didn't learn a ton in this iteration
because I've already done most of this in CS3300 but it
was great review and will definitly help me going forward. 
The one thing I did learn was how to start working with a 
group using github. I've never had to merge someone elses 
work with mine so it was good practice. 

Neako Hallisey: As far as hands-on (coding) stuff goes, 
I didn't learn a whole lot for this sprint. This was 
a nice refresher on how to collaborate with others in 
github though, I've done it before but with an extension
tool called gitkraken, some things are the same, some are
different. I suppose the hardest step for this sprint 
was getting everything running on github and DevEdu. 

Joel Flinn: For this sprint, I learned a little about how
to use css to make help style a sheet for front end development.
I ran into some trouble with drawing css classes from the static
folder, so I put all of our css classes in their respectice html
files. While trouble shooting this issue, I learned that the
STATICFILES_DIRS variable is used to help django find the location
of the static files.
