Jagger Zlotoff: I didn't learn a ton in this iteration
because I've already done most of this in CS3300 but it
was great review and will definitly help me going forward. 
The one thing I did learn was how to start working with a 
group using github. I've never had to merge someone elses 
work with mine so it was good practice. 

Neako Hallisey: As far as hands-on (coding) stuff goes, 
I didn't learn a whole lot for this sprint. This was 
a nice refresher on how to collaborate with others in 
github though, I've done it before but with an extension
tool called gitkraken, some things are the same, some are
different. I suppose the hardest step for this sprint 
was getting everything running on github and DevEdu.
